**Ingredients** 


- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened 

- 1 cup dark brown sugar 

- ½ cup sugar

- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 

- 1 large egg

- 1½ cups all-purpose flour 

- 1 cup cake flour 

- 1¼ tsp sea salt 

- ¼ tsp baking soda 

- ½ tsp baking powder 

- 2 Tbsp cornstarch 

- 1¾ cups chocolate chips

**Instructions**


- Using a stand mixer, whip butter with both sugars on high speed for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the mixture becomes light and airy. 

- Add vanilla extract, egg and egg yolks. Mix on medium-low speed until fully incorporated. 

- Gradually add the all-purpose flour, cake flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and cornstarch. 

- Mix on low speed for approximately 1 minute, or until just combined. Gently fold in chocolate chips, distributing evenly throughout the dough. 

 
 

- Portion dough into generous (4-oz/½-cup) balls.

- Arrange on a parchment-lined tray and freeze, covered, for at least 1 hour or ideally overnight. 

- Transfer dough balls to a baking sheet, sprinkle with flaky sea salt and bake at 420 F for 16 minutes, or until golden.

- Allow cookies to rest briefly before serving for optimal texture and flavor. Makes 6 large cookies.
