**Ingredients**

- 2 cups shredded cooked chicken

- 1/2 cup cream cheese, softened

- 6 tablespoons of ranch dressing, (homemade is better but store bought works fine)

- 6 tablespoons Frank’s Red Hot
 
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar

- 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella

- 6 small flour tortillas, 6 inch is perfect

- Neutral oil (avocado is great)

- Crumbled blue cheese for garnish


**Directions**


- Combine chicken, cream cheese, 1/4 cup of the ranch, 1/4 cup of Frank's, cheddar and mozzarella - mix really well until creamy and scoopable - yes, scoopable


- Put remaining ranch and Frank's in a small bowl - set aside


- Put 1/3 cup of the filling in the center of a tortilla, and press it down flat so it spreads out to the edges


- Heat a large non-stick pan over medium high, add thin layer of oil and when hot place the tortilla filling-side down - give a little squish so all of the filling makes contact


- Let it sear 2–3 minutes (don't move it) until crispy and golden underneath


- Using a wide spatula and a quick motion, carefully flip the taco over, press lightly and cook another 1–2 minutes to crisp the other side and melt everything


- Remove, add some crumbled blue cheese if desired, fold and dip into the extra buffalo ranch sauce
